# mlb-pitch-patterns
EDA of MLB pitching data.

Data wrangling inspired by https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/visuals/pitch-plinko.

Pitch data were pulled using https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball.

Jupyternotebook walks through steps to create a node-edge list for pitch counts to create network graphs similar to baseball savant.

The network graphs were recreated in a Tableau work book [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/owen.boberg/viz/Book3_15796588681510/Dashboard1) along with addtional pitch stats and graphics.
